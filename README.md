# Pg

Ruby on Rails application initialized with [Hix on Rails][hixonrails].

## System dependencies

- Ruby version: 2.7.2
- Rails version: 6.1.3
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Redis installed

## Configuration

Copy an existing sample environment file. Run:
```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

and edit newly created `.env` file. The minimum you are going to need are
credentials to your local PostgreSQL database.

Then, install all the necessary gems:
```bash
bundle install
```

## Database creation

In order to create the database with all the necessary seed data, run:
```bash
$ rails db:create db:structure:load:with_data db:seed
```

## How to start the app

The simplest way to start the app is using `foreman` gem.
```bash
gem install foreman
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```
It is not included in the _Gemfile_, [as advised in its documentation][foreman].

If you prefer running all of the processes separately, read on.

Start the Ruby on Rails server with:
```bash
rails server
```
To run Sidekiq, launch another process with:
```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```
In order to intercept emails sent with ActionMailer in development
install the `mailcatcher` gem locally:
```bash
gem install mailcatcher
```
and visit your mailbox [http://127.0.0.1:1080/](http://127.0.0.1:1080/).

All emails send with your app will appear here.

## How to run the test suite

In order to run the whole test suite, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Code quality checks
